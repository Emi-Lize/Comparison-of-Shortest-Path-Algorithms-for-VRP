# Comparison of Shortest Path Algorithms for a Variation of Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP): Dijkstra, A* Search and Random Walk
The aim of this project is to find the best shortest path algorithm to tackle a variation of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) based on the present-day door-to-door delivery services whereby the parcel is picked up from an individual sender and delivered to the doorstep of each receipient. Some examples of this service would be Lalamove and GrabExpress in Malaysia. The best algorithm is decided based on the total distance travelled by the driver and the average waiting time of the receiver.

## Results
| | Dijkstra | A* Search | Random Walk |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Average Total Distance Travelled|453.3|453.3|813.8|
|Average Waiting Time |119.82|119.82|244.04|
|Average Runtime (ms) |2.1922|0.9480|
